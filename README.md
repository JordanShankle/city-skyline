This is a project I did while first learning to code, September 24th, 2022. I did it as part of the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum.

In this project, I learn CSS variables. CSS Variables help you organize your styles and reuse them. I used CSS variables to build a city skyline. You'll learn how to configure CSS variables so you can reuse them whenever you want.
